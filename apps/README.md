apps

This folder contains three frontend applications built with React + Vite:

- `customer-app` — Passenger-facing mobile/web app scaffold
- `driver-app` — Driver-facing app scaffold
- `admin-dashboard` — Admin dashboard scaffold

Each app is a minimal Vite + React project. Use `npm install` then `npm run dev` inside each app.

Environment:
- Each app reads backend base URL from `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` (see `.env.example`).
